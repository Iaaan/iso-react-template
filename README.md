## Another express and react isomorphic app template

### Why?
After working with React/iso/flux apps for a while, this template has become my go-to for getting started.
Let's face it. There's a boat load of boilerplate work that goes into setting up one of these apps.

### Features
- Webpack configuration
- Iso setup on server and client
- Babel setup for server specific code
- Router setup

### Getting started
1. Copy repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start:dev`

### Building
1. For dev (nodemon, watch mode, source maps), run `npm run build:dev` or `npm run start:dev` to build then start server.
2. For prod (compiled server code, optimized bundles), run `npm run build:prod` or `npm run start:prod` to build then start server.

### Linting
Run `npm run lint`

### Testing
1. TODO: setup tests with karma, mocha, and JSDOM
