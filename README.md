# Another Express and React isomorphic app template

## Why?
After working with React/iso/flux apps for a while, this template has become my go-to for getting started. Let's face it. There's a boat load of boilerplate work that goes into setting up an app with these features.

## Features
- Webpack configuration
- Iso setup on server and client
- Babel setup for server specific code
- Router setup

## Getting started
1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install`

## Build
1. Run `npm run build:dev`
TODO: setup prod webpack config
TODO: setup dev-server, hotload, and nodemon
