## Another express and react isomorphic app template

### Why?
After working with React/iso/flux apps for a while, this template has become my go-to for getting started.
Let's face it. There's a boat load of boilerplate work that goes into setting up one of these apps.

### Features
- Webpack configuration
- Iso setup on server and client
- Babel setup for server specific code
- Router setup

### Getting started
1. Copy repo
2. Run `npm install`

### Building
1. Run `npm run build:dev`
- TODO: setup prod webpack config
- TODO: setup dev-server, hotloader, and nodemon

### Linting
Run `npm run lint`

### Testing
1. TODO: setup tests with karma, mocha, and JSDOM
